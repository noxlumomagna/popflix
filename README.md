Inspired by the popular streaming website Disney+, PopFlix was made using React, SASS, movie API from themoviedb, and Javascript

# PopFlix
    
    npm install
    Use:  "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start" under scripts in package.json to use some of the older components and dependencies

Tech Used: React, JS, SCSS, HTML, CSS. I dove into React to build out the movie app. 

Optimizations

Some goals for improvement:

decrease load times on-click
ability it incorporate user preferences with more involved backend
additional search features

Lessons Learned
I had to learn a lot about connecting frontend with the API. Using fetch and axios took some time to get used to. Something that I am proud the final result and overall quality vs time spent. I was excited about everything coming together.
